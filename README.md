# hermes

The program watches for file changes in the project directory given and runs or builds or tests the project
for every change made (notify.ALL). Works on Linux.

Still a work in progress.

Catchy name ðŸ˜‚.
The program should help when using go's templating system in doing frontend work (why not automate thisðŸ˜­).
Or whatever else you may find it useful for.


It relies on "github.com/rjeczalik/notify" repo.

Any comments, suggestions, PRs, or code reviews are welcome.
